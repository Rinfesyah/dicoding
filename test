Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. This neural network attempts to simulate the behavior of the human brain—although it falls far short of its capabilities—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with one layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize and refine accuracy.

Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that increase automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. Deep learning technology is behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as emerging technologies (such as driverless cars).
